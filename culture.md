There are many things we all can do without any training or experience. These are the basics that everyone at LocoNav is expected to internalise and follow. We belive that these qualities will help you become the best in whatever you do.

1. Be frugal: Money saved is money earned. This is one thing COVID has taught us all. Think before requesting to purchase that $50 subscription. If you can write an excel formula or a script to do it, write it. Spend it like it is your money.
1. Be ready for any task: No task is below you. Sending that email, writing test cases, helping the support team with a trivial customer issue. Throw your ego out of the window and just do it.
1. Be responsible: if you are given a task, make sure you do it or come back with a reason why you weren’t able to do it. You can’t simply ignore.
1. Be on time: Everyone’s time is important. Being late by “just 5 minutes” is not okay.

1. Be humble and be coachable. No one knows everything. Be humble when you know more than the other person, be coachable when you don’t.
1. Reply to all emails and messages: There is no good reason for not replying to a message. Make sure you are prompt in your responses.
1. Learn how to write an email: Improve upon your writing skills. Your emails should be slightly formal, in positive tone and without any grammatical errors. Follow any good email format.
1. Own your mistakes: It is okay to make mistakes. It is not okay to hide them.
1. Ask good questions - http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
